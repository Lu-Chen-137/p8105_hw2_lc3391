Problem 1
=========

Read data by sheets, and clean the datasets
-------------------------------------------

``` r
trash_wheel = read_excel( "Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
                         range = "A2:N338", na = "" ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, 0)))

p_2017 = read_excel( "Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation", 
                     range = "A2:B14", na = "") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017)

p_2018 = read_excel( "Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
                     range = "A2:B14", na = "") %>%  
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)

combined_p = left_join(p_2017, p_2018, by = c("month")) %>% 
  mutate(Month = month.name)
```

-   There are 286 observations in the dataset Trash Wheel, and one of the key variables is volumn.
-   The number of observations in Combined Precipitation is 12, and the number of precipitation is one of the key variable.
-   The total precipitation rate in 2018 is 70.33, and the median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 is 8.
